								<p>I am a 25 year old avid plant mom. My apartment is overflowing with greenery. 
									I am recently married and celebrated my first anniversary on 09/14/2019. 
									I love computer science and art. I tend to fall into something I am passionate 
									about and spend most of my time doing that thing.  I'm a fan of Led Zeppelin, Metallica and 
									Glass Animals. Three words to describe myself: prioritized, adaptable, and driven.</p>

									This project was geared towards developing a first and second grader based math game completed during my Software Engineering course at Westminster College.
									From this, I really gained exposure as to what working in the industry as a Software Engineer would be like. From day one,
									we were thrown right into our groups and the project! It was a team effort, which I had the opportunity to lead. 
									<br><br>
									Completing this project gave me the confidence to pursue a Software Engineer Internship that I began in May 2019. This project was successful in 
									teaching me the concepts and techniques of software design. It also helped me understand the concepts and techniques of
									object-oriented software design, both individually and in the group setting. Being my first software application, it also helped me to
									develop effective problem solving skills that I still use today.

								<p class="pb-100">
									In Fall 2019, I took Computer Networks. Throughout the course I learned about both hardware and software components involved in networks. 
									I learned about various protocols, focusing on TCP/IP networks and the web. Networks, security, and operating sytems are all part of the side
									of computers that I always felt that I knew nothing about. I was always nervous to take these courses, but by the end of the semester and the 
									final project, I felt a lot more confident about this side of computer science. 
									<br><br>
									The chat application consisted of a multi-threaded server that could connect to any number of clients.
									The server would update as threads entered and left the chat. For this project, I learned about multi-threading,
									race conditions on data, and server reliability. This project really allowed me to understand the relationship between the 
									various levels in a computer system and network. This is one of the CS department goals, and also something I knew little about beforehand.

								<p class="pb-100">
									Over the summer of 2019, I spent time learning more about CSS and HTML. I decided to mess around with a project creating an online version of my resume.
									It is not hosted anywhere at the moment, but I have the sources if I choose to host. Something I was excited about for this 
									online resume was the ability to click on the "Download Resume" button and have a PDF version of my resume come up, ready to view or print.
									<br><br>
									From the time I spent learning the basics of HTML and CSS over that summer, I was able to take the course Web Applications
									and have much more success during the semester. The first few weeks of the course went over the essentials of HTML and CSS, and instead of learning
									this information for the first time, I was able to have a refreshed on what I had learned myself and I was able to better
									solidify these skills. This knowledge has been incredibly useful for me as I have continued my degree.

								<p class="pb-100">
										Asteroids was the first project that really stuck with me upon pursing my Computer Science degree. Completing this game really
										inspired me. Being able to see and play something that I worked so hard on, actually work, was an incredible feeling. I look back at 
										this project with gratitude. It is incredible to see how much I have grown and how far I have come. 
										<br><br>
										Asteroids really pushed my critical thinking in computer science. Being part of my first CS semester, it taught me things about computers I had never learned before.
										It helped me develop effective problem solving skills, which are essential in this field. And while most of the other assignments the semester were done in group settings,
										this projet really gave me significant exposure working individually on a larger project.

									For my Web Applications course, we had a integrated classroom with communications students. These students designed color schemes, wire-frames,
									logos, color palletes, and mood boards for a web application we would develop for a local business. It was up to us as software developers to make their ideas a reality.
									During this project, I was voted as the team lead. I handled assignment submissions, meet-ups, making sure we followed our timeline, and was the client point-of-contact. 
									<br><br>
									This project really emphasized the college-wide learning goals: critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, communication and global responsibility. 
									Developing a web app for a local business really emphasized the global responsibility towards our local community. Working with a group, and students of another major, really pushed
									our collaboration and communication as a team. We were able to combine the creativity of the design students with the critical thinking of the developers and produce
									a product that we all were proud of.

								<p class="pb-100">
									For my senior capstone, I worked on developing a web application for my immediate family’s plumbing business, Matthew’s Plumbing Service, Inc. The ultimate goal of this project was to simplify life for my parents by applying what I know, learning new valuable skills and tools, and exploring my interest in software development and engineering as I had become increasingly interested in the idea of developing web applications for small businesses. The application would increase the company’s online presence, give new customers the ability to request free estimates through the application, and give active customers the ability to pay their invoices online.
									<br><br>
									This project really encapsulated the college wide learning goals, as well as the CS department learning goals for Westminster. I gained more exposure with how the back end of computers work, as well as network security.
									Working in java, I gained more exposure in designing, writing, and testing with object-oriented programming.
									While my other software projects were done in group settings, this project was individual and really pushed my capabilities.
									And throughout this process, I greatly developed effective problem solving skills, along with a deeper passion for software development.
